# Beta notes / Important information

This SDK uses the new API V2 of pingen v2. Pingen v2 does not share any data with v1 and therefore separate accounts
are required. Currently V2 is still in beta and will be released to the general public in the summer of 2021.

To access V2 you need to be invited and receive oauth2 credentials.

If you are looking for the SDK for pingen v1, please visit this repository: https://github.com/pingencom/pingen

# Versioning

We adhere to semantic (major.minor.patch) versioning (https://semver.org/). This means that:
* Patch (x.x.patch) versions fix bugs
* Minor (x.minor.x) versions introduce new, backwards compatible features or improve existing code.
* Major (major.x.x) versions introduce radical changes which are not backwards compatible.

In your automation or procedure you can always safely update patch & minor versions without the risk of your application failing.
